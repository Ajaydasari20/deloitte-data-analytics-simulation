## 📊 Tasks Completed

### 1. **Equality Score Analysis**
- Cleaned and analyzed data across 4 factory sites: Meiyo, Seiko, Berlin, and Shenzhen.
- Evaluated job roles for bias and discrimination using an equality scoring framework.

### 2. **Data Visualization in Tableau**
- Built dashboards to identify the most unhealthy factory environments.
- Visualized:
  - Sum of unhealthiness by factory.
  - Sum of unhealthiness by device type.

### 3. **Key Insights**
- **Daikibo Seiko** showed the highest level of unhealthy practices.
- **Laser Welder** device type contributed heavily to the issues.
- Several management and operational roles had significantly negative equality scores.
